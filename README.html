# Byte Stars

Byte Stars is a 2D sprite-based game developed for embedded systems, with an emphasis on low-level graphics control, joystick input, and frame-based animation. It was created as a platform to experiment with real-time input handling, sprite rendering, and background management using microcontroller hardware.

## Overview

The game runs on a Texas Instruments MSPM0G3507 microcontroller and uses an ST7735-based TFT LCD display for visual output. The player controls a sprite using an analog joystick, navigating across a simple game world rendered in real-time. Byte Stars focuses on demonstrating core embedded systems skills such as hardware interfacing, ADC usage, timer-based loops, and graphical performance optimizations.

## Features

- Joystick-based movement using ADC1 channels
- Sprite animation using frame toggling
- Background detection and redrawing to simulate transparency
- Display rendering on a 128x160 ST7735 LCD in portrait mode
- Efficient drawing and erasing of moving objects to reduce flickering
- Modular code structure for maintainability and expansion

## Hardware Requirements

- MSPM0G3507 microcontroller (or similar MSPM0+ series)
- ST7735 1.8" TFT LCD (SPI interface)
- Analog joystick connected to ADC-capable GPIO pins
- Power supply (via USB or battery)
- Optional: speaker and DAC for sound

## File Structure

- `main.c` – Entry point, initialization, and game loop
- `JoyStick.c/h` – ADC configuration and input reading
- `Sprite.c/h` – Sprite drawing and animation logic
- `Background.c/h` – Background detection and redrawing
- `ST7735.c/h` – Display driver routines
- `Timer.c/h` – Timer initialization for game loop pacing

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in Code Composer Studio (or compatible IDE).
3. Connect your MSPM0 board and LCD display.
4. Flash the firmware onto the device.
5. Reset the board and use the joystick to control the sprite.

## Controls

- **Move**: Tilt joystick up, down, left, or right
- **Reset**: Power cycle or press reset button on board

## Notes

- The game is designed for portrait mode (rotation 1) on the ST7735 LCD.
- Background redraw functions assume a clean Fill pass before sprite drawing.
- Joystick input is scaled and thresholded with a dead zone to prevent drift.

## Future Improvements

- Add game logic (collision detection, scoring)
- Implement additional levels or backgrounds
- Add sound effects using DAC and timers
- Create a menu or start screen
